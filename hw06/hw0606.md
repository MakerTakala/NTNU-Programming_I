# hw0606

We found the description in manual for %n.
> The number of characters written so far is stored into the integer pointed to by the corresponding argument. That argument shall be an int *, or variant whose size matches the (optionally) supplied integer length modifier. No argument is converted. (This specifier is not supported by the bionic C library.)The behavior is undefined if the conversion specification includes any flags, a field width, or a precision.

%n will return The number of characters written so far with int* type. Thus, I wrote a program to test.(hw0606.c)
We found N1 is 3 due to the The number of characters written so far is "123", and N2 is 7 due to the The number of characters written so far is "123456\n".
