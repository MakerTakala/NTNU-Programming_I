## float <-> int32_t
### 6.3.1.4 Real floating and integer

> 1.When a finite value of real floating type is converted to an integer type other than _Bool,
the fractional part is discarded (i.e., the value is truncated toward zero). If the value of
the integral part cannot be represented by the integer type, the behavior is undefined.

> 2.When a value of integer type is converted to a real floating type, if the value being
converted can be represented exactly in the new type, it is unchanged. If the value being
converted is in the range of values that can be represented but cannot be represented
exactly, the result is either the nearest higher or nearest lower representable value, chosen
in an implementation-defined manner. If the value being converted is outside the range of
values that can be represented, the behavior is undefined. Results of some implicit
conversions may be represented in greater range and precision than that required by the
new type (see 6.3.1.8 and 6.8.6.4)

### IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic  F.4 Floating to integer conversion

> If the integer type is _Bool, 6.3.1.2 applies and no floating-point exceptions are raised
(even for NaN). Otherwise, if the floating value is infinite or NaN or if the integral part
of the floating value exceeds the range of the integer type, then the ‘‘invalid’’ floating point exception is raised and the resulting value is unspecified. Otherwise, the resulting
value is determined by 6.3.1.4. Conversion of an integral floating value that does not
exceed the range of the integer type raises no floating-point exceptions; whether
conversion of a non-integral floating value raises the inexact floating-point exception is unspecified.

## float -> int32_t
*If the value of rhe integral part can be represented by intteger32 type, the fractional part is discarded, if not, the behavior is undefined.
*If the floating value is infinite or NaN or if the integral part of the floating value exceeds the range of the integer type, then the invalid floating point exception is raised and the resulting value is unspecified.

### example
1111.1111 -> 1111
54321.12345 -> 54321
NaN & ntegral part of the floating value exceeds -> unspecified

## int32_t -> float
