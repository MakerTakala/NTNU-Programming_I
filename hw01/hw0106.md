Use the "gcc -v " to compile a code file, and I find a message in Terminal.

#include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/9/include
 /usr/local/include
 /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu
 /usr/include
End of searchfin  list.

Beacuse Terminal say "#include <...> search starts here", I guess stdio.h may in above path.
Then, use "cd .." to back to root and list the files.
We can find the "usr" directory.

By Google, I learned I can use "find (path) -name (filename)" to find the file.
After searching, I got 3 file.
    /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/stdio.h
    /usr/include/stdio.h
    /usr/include/c++/9/tr1/stdio.h

Reading the annotation we can exclude the file3.
Then, I try to rename the file, compile the file and see what happen.
"sudo mv stdio.h not_stdio.h"
In file1, there is nothing happen.
In file2, when I compile the code, there is a message:
    test.c:1:10: fatal error: stdio.h: No such file or directory
    1 | #include <stdio.h>
      |          ^~~~~~~~~
the compile fail, and say no such file or directory.
System can't find <stdio.h>

Thus, I guess the <stdio.h> path is /usr/include/c++/9/tr1/stdio.h .
