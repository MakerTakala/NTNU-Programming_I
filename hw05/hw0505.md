### ORIGINAL CODE:
    #include <stdint.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    unsigned int ui = 0;
    unsigned short us = 0;
    signed int si = -1;

    int main()
    {   
        int64_t r1 = ui + si;
        int64_t r2 = us + si;
        printf("%ld %ld\n", r1, r2);
    }

### RESULT:
    4294967295 -1

## 6.3 Conversions
> If an int can represent all values of the original type (as restricted by the width, for abit-field), the value is converted to an int; otherwise, it is converted to an unsignedint. These are called the integer promotions.58) All other types are unchanged by theinteger promotions.

Thus, we can know when the program calculate the "unsigned int + signed int", it will be promote to "unsigned int + unsigned int",
and if we present "si" in binary number, it will become 1111111111111111111111111111111(2), and if it be promote to unsighed int, it value will be 2^31. Therefore, r1 = 2^31 + 2^31 = 4294967295.

Besides, when calculate r2, us will be promote to "int", and us will become 0. Therefore, r2 = 0 + -1 = -1.
