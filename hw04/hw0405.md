# hw0405

In C spec 

## 7.21.6.3 The printf function

### Returns
> The printf function returns the number of characters transmitted, or a negative value if
an output or encoding error occurred.

## 7.21.6.4 The scanf function

### Returns
> The scanf function returns the value of the macro EOF if an input failure occurs before
the first conversion (if any) has completed. Otherwise, the scanf function returns the
number of input items assigned, which can be fewer than provided for, or even zero, in

## experience ans sample code
Excute hw0405.c, we can try to input 1 2 3

Terminal:

> 1 2 3  
1 2 3  
input: 3  
output: 6  

we can know the scanf function return returns the number of input items assigned, and we can know printf returns the number of characters transmitted.Besides, we can also know printf return number include "\n" as one word.

### How about input some word?

Terminal:

> hlw iweo wwo   
0 0 0  
input: 0  
output: 6  

scanf function return 0 because the variable didn't be assigned.

### How about input the bigger number?

Terminal:

> 123 456 789  
123 456 789  
input: 3  
output: 12  

printf function return 12 beacuse the output is 12 words long "123 456 789\n"
